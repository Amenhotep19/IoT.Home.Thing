This project applied a [IoT Starter](https://github.com/josemotta/IoT.Starter) to speed up the  development. The initial code was extracted from [IoT.Starter.Pi.Thing](https://github.com/josemotta/IoT.Starter.Pi.Thing), that provides embryos for Home Intelligence using Raspberry Pi with Linux, Docker & .NET Core.
