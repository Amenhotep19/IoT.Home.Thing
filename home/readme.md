# IoT.Home.Thing

#### IoT Home Intelligence with Raspberry Pi

### *powered by IoT.Starter.Pi.Thing

This project applied a [IoT Starter](https://github.com/josemotta/IoT.Starter) to speed up the  development. The initial code was extracted from [IoT.Starter.Pi.Thing](https://github.com/josemotta/IoT.Starter.Pi.Thing), that provides embryos for Home Intelligence using Raspberry Pi with Linux, Docker & .NET Core.

This project is being designed to be used itself  as a IoT Starter for Home Intelligence projects with following requirements:

- support for legacy infrared gadgets already available at home, as home theater, air conditioner, heaters, lights, etc.;
- based on Raspberry Pi with Linux;
- need a software library that includes I/O for input & output of digital & analog pins and support for various hardware components;
- explore docker containers built on speedy machines, pushed to cloud, and  deployed to linux-arm.
